# POPULATION
# 	Properties
#		INDIS				array of individuals
#		Size				size of pop
#		Breeding method(s)	array of touples; Name of methos, percent of pop [string, int] 
#		numCases			Number of fitness cases
#		hitCriteria			Criteria for a hit (how fit it has to be)
#	 Methods
#		makeNewPop			make a new population
#		fitness				evaluate fitness of population
#		makeNextPop			create the next generation


# INDI
# Individuals for this population are Neural Networks and have all of their properties in addition
# to these
#	Properties
#		Fitnesses			An array of ints, corresponding to the various computed fitness measures
#			Raw
#			Adjusted
#			Normalized
#		Hits				the number of fitness cases this individual has performed well in		


# MAIN
# You will need some sort of main function to run the GA.  
# And that main method will need some inputs:
#	Pop size (pass through to pop)
#	pretty much all of the other POPULATION fields too
#	number of generations, the number of generations to run the system
#	termination criteria, typically, a goal fitness s.t. if an indi reaches it the simulation stops
